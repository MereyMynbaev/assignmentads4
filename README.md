# Graph Search Algorithms

This project implements two graph search algorithms: Dijkstra's algorithm for weighted graphs and Breadth-First Search (BFS) for unweighted graphs. The implementation demonstrates how to find paths between cities in a graph.

## Features

- **Dijkstra's Algorithm:** Finds the shortest path in a weighted graph.
- **Breadth-First Search (BFS):** Finds the shortest path in an unweighted graph.
- Example graphs with cities as nodes and connections as edges.

## Project Structure

- `Main.java`: Entry point of the application. It sets up the graphs, performs the searches, and prints the paths.
- `Graph.java`: Interface defining the basic graph operations.
- `MyGraph.java`: Implementation of an unweighted graph.
- `WeightedGraph.java`: Implementation of a weighted graph.
- `Vertex.java`: Represents a vertex in the weighted graph.
- `Search.java`: Interface for search algorithms.
- `DijkstraSearch.java`: Implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm.
- `BreadthFirstSearch.java`: Implementation of BFS.
